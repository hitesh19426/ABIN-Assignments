Instructions:
1) Allowed programming language is python.
2) Write clean code with proper comments at appropriate places as it will be checked.
3) You should submit a ZIP file consisting of the program and a pdf file listing the program and sample screenshots of its working. Name the ZIP file as: ABIN-A2-<Name>-<RollNo>. 


QUESTION:
For a collection of strings, a larger string containing every one of the smaller strings as a substring is called a superstring.
By the assumption of parsimony, a shortest possible superstring over a collection of reads serves as a candidate chromosome.

Given: A collection of DNA strings of equal length.
The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.

Return: A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).Sample Dataset
